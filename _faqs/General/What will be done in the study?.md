Question: What will be done in the study?

Answer: This study will be conducted in 2 parts.
* In Part 1, we will get you to fill in some questionnaires about your child’s behavior and mood to screen for any mental health concerns. This will be done online, and you may opt to receive your child’s screening result.
*  If your child is screened to have some risk of mental health issues, we will invite you for a further assessment with a trained mental health professional to confirm any mental health problems he/she may be struggling with. However, an invitation is not an indication of a mental health diagnosis. We might also invite you for further assessment even if your child does not screen positive for any mental health risks, in order to ensure that our screening procedures are adequately accurate.
*  In Part 2, selected participants will be invited for further assessment at our clinic. Participation is completely voluntary.
