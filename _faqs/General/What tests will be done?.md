The list of conditions that we are screening for are as follows:

1.  **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**
* A neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how one interacts with others, communicates, learn and behave. Often, people with ASD have difficulties communicating and interacting with other people, show restricted or repetitive interests or behaviours, and are affected in their abilities to function as school, work, or other areas of life.

2.  **Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD)**
*  A neurodevelopmental disorder that affects one’s ability to pay attention, control impulsive behaviours, or be overly active.

3.   **Depressive Disorders**
* A mental health condition that involves a depressed mood, or loss of pleasure and/or interest in activities for long periods of time. This is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life.

4.   **Anxiety Disorders**

*  A mental health condition that involves persistent feeling of anxiety or dread, which interferes with daily life. This is not the same as occasionally worrying about things or stressing about life events.
