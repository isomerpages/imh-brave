Question:   Who will be able to see my child’s data?
* I am worried that my child will be labelled as mentally ill after participating in the study.
* Will my child’s school know the results of his screening?

Answer: All data and results collected as part of the study is **strictly confidential** and will not be made available for persons outside of the study team. A diagnosis report will be provided for participants who have been invited for further assessments and meet criteria for the diagnosis of one or more mental health conditions. You may choose to share this information with your child/ward’s school or service providers (e.g., doctors and psychologists) to help them support your child better.
