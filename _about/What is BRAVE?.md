BRAVE is Singaporeâ€™s first child and adolescent mental health study. We want to study the prevalence of mental health issues in children and adolescents below 18 years old. BRAVE is an important nation-wide medical research study that gathers data from you and your child over up to 3 sessions across 3 years. As part of this study, mental health screening and assessment for your child will be conducted at no charge to you. This study will give us better insight and understanding in the prevention and management of child and adolescent mental health issues like depression and anxiety in Singapore.
